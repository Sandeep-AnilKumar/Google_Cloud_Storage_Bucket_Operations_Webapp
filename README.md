#Google_Cloud_Storage_Bucket_Operations_Webapp

You will need a Google Cloud Platform account and a bucket in the Google Cloud Storage. Once you have these ready, you can authenticate your service account.

Have a look into these: - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login

After which you will be able to use the web application and query your "bucket-name" and see the contents of it, delete the items, upload the new items as well as download them.

Do get back to me if you need any assistance. Phone: - 312 468-5815 Email: - sanilk2@uic.edu"# Google_Cloud_Storage_Bucket_Operations_Webapp"
